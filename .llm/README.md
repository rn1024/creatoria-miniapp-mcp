# LLM Task Hub

This directory tracks the current migration preparation work for the Creatoria MiniApp MCP project.

## How to Use
- Start by reading the active task cards in `./task_cards/`. Each card follows the 6A checklist and can be executed independently.
- Update `state.json` when major milestones shift or when a task card is completed.
- Record execution notes in future session logs as needed.

## Key References
- `docs/directory-structure-and-code-style-best-practices.md`: Proposed structure and coding standards for the migration.
- `README.md`: High-level project overview and CLI usage.
- `CHANGELOG.md`: Release history and context.

The previous progress artifacts were cleared on branch `migration-structure-prep` to begin the migration planning from a clean slate.
